    "html": "<article class=\"day-desc\"><h2>--- Day 1: Secret Entrance ---</h2><p>The Elves have good news and bad news.</p>\n<p>The good news is that they've discovered <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management\" target=\"_blank\">project management</a>! This has given them the tools they need to prevent their usual Christmas emergency. For example, they now know that the North Pole decorations need to be finished soon so that other critical tasks can start on time.</p>\n<p>The bad news is that they've realized they have a <em>different</em> emergency: according to their resource planning, none of them have any time left to decorate the North Pole!</p>\n<p>To save Christmas, the Elves need <em>you</em> to <em>finish decorating the North Pole by December 12th</em>.</p>\n<p>Collect stars by solving puzzles.  Two puzzles will be made available on each day; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first.  Each puzzle grants <em class=\"star\">one star</em>. Good luck!</p>\n<p>You arrive at the secret entrance to the North Pole base ready to start decorating. Unfortunately, the <em>password</em> seems to have been changed, so you can't get in. A document taped to the wall helpfully explains:</p>\n<p>\"Due to new security protocols, the password is locked in the safe below. Please see the attached document for the new combination.\"</p>\n<p>The safe has a dial with only an arrow on it; around the dial are the numbers <code>0</code> through <code>99</code> in order. As you turn the dial, it makes a small <em>click</em> noise as it reaches each number.</p>\n<p>The attached document (your puzzle input) contains a sequence of <em>rotations</em>, one per line, which tell you how to open the safe. A rotation starts with an <code>L</code> or <code>R</code> which indicates whether the rotation should be to the <em>left</em> (toward lower numbers) or to the <em>right</em> (toward higher numbers). Then, the rotation has a <em>distance</em> value which indicates how many clicks the dial should be rotated in that direction.</p>\n<p>So, if the dial were pointing at <code>11</code>, a rotation of <code>R8</code> would cause the dial to point at <code>19</code>. After that, a rotation of <code>L19</code> would cause it to point at <code>0</code>.</p>\n<p>Because the dial is a circle, turning the dial <em>left from <code>0</code></em> one click makes it point at <code>99</code>. Similarly, turning the dial <em>right from <code>99</code></em> one click makes it point at <code>0</code>.</p>\n<p>So, if the dial were pointing at <code>5</code>, a rotation of <code>L10</code> would cause it to point at <code>95</code>. After that, a rotation of <code>R5</code> could cause it to point at <code>0</code>.</p>\n<p>The dial starts by pointing at <code>50</code>.</p>\n<p>You could follow the instructions, but your recent required official North Pole secret entrance security training seminar taught you that the safe is actually a decoy. The actual password is <em>the number of times the dial is left pointing at <code>0</code> after any rotation in the sequence</em>.</p>\n<p>For example, suppose the attached document contained the following rotations:</p>\n<pre><code>L68\nL30\nR48\nL5\nR60\nL55\nL1\nL99\nR14\nL82\n</code></pre>\n<p>Following these rotations would cause the dial to move as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The dial starts by pointing at <code>50</code>.</li>\n<li>The dial is rotated <code>L68</code> to point at <code>82</code>.</li>\n<li>The dial is rotated <code>L30</code> to point at <code>52</code>.</li>\n<li>The dial is rotated <code>R48</code> to point at <code><em>0</em></code>.</li>\n<li>The dial is rotated <code>L5</code> to point at <code>95</code>.</li>\n<li>The dial is rotated <code>R60</code> to point at <code>55</code>.</li>\n<li>The dial is rotated <code>L55</code> to point at <code><em>0</em></code>.</li>\n<li>The dial is rotated <code>L1</code> to point at <code>99</code>.</li>\n<li>The dial is rotated <code>L99</code> to point at <code><em>0</em></code>.</li>\n<li>The dial is rotated <code>R14</code> to point at <code>14</code>.</li>\n<li>The dial is rotated <code>L82</code> to point at <code>32</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because the dial points at <code>0</code> a total of three times during this process, the password in this example is <code><em>3</em></code>.</p>\n<p>Analyze the rotations in your attached document. <em>What's the actual password to open the door?</em></p>\n</article><article class=\"day-desc\"><h2 id=\"part2\">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>You're sure that's the right password, but the door won't open. You knock, but nobody answers.

So, in this example, the new password would be <code><em>6</em></code>.</p>\n<p>Be careful: if the dial were pointing at <code>50</code>, a single rotation like <code>R1000</code> would cause the dial to point at <code>0</code> ten times before returning back to <code>50</code>!</p>\n<p>Using password method 0x434C49434B, <em>what is the password to open the door?</em></p>\n</article>",

You aren't sure who is even allowed to visit the North Pole, but you know you can access the lobby through here, and from there you can access the rest of the North Pole base.</p>\n<p>As you make your way through the <span title=\"They even sell lunch boxes and blue tents!\">surprisingly extensive</span> selection, one of the clerks recognizes you and asks for your help.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, one of the younger Elves was playing on a gift shop computer and managed to add a whole bunch of invalid product IDs to their gift shop database! Surely, it would be no trouble for you to identify the invalid product IDs for them, right?</p>\n<p>They've even checked most of the product ID ranges already; they only have a few product ID ranges (your puzzle input) that you'll need to check. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>11-22,95-115,998-1012,1188511880-1188511890,222220-222224,\n1698522-1698528,446443-446449,38593856-38593862,565653-565659,\n824824821-824824827,2121212118-2121212124</code></pre>\n<p>(The ID ranges are wrapped here for legibility; in your input, they appear on a single long line.)</p>\n<p>The ranges are separated by commas (<code>,</code>); each range gives its <em>first ID</em> and <em>last ID</em> separated by a dash (<code>-</code>).</p>\n<p>Since the young Elf was just doing silly patterns, you can find the <em>invalid IDs</em> by looking for any ID which is made only of some sequence of digits repeated twice. So, <code>55</code> (<code>5</code> twice), <code>6464</code> (<code>64</code> twice), and <code>123123</code> (<code>123</code> twice) would all be invalid IDs.</p>\n<p>None of the numbers have leading zeroes; <code>0101</code> isn't an ID at all. (<code>101</code> is a <em>valid</em> ID that you would ignore.)</p>\n<p>Your job is to find all of the invalid IDs that appear in the given ranges. In the above example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>11-22</code> has two invalid IDs, <code><em>11</em></code> and <code><em>22</em></code>.</li>\n<li><code>95-115</code> has one invalid ID, <code><em>99</em></code>.</li>\n<li><code>998-1012</code> has one invalid ID, <code><em>1010</em></code>.</li>\n<li><code>1188511880-1188511890</code> has one invalid ID, <code><em>1188511885</em></code>.</li>\n<li><code>222220-222224</code> has one invalid ID, <code><em>222222</em></code>.</li>\n<li><code>1698522-1698528</code> contains no invalid IDs.</li>\n<li><code>446443-446449</code> has one invalid ID, <code><em>446446</em></code>.</li>\n<li><code>38593856-38593862</code> has one invalid ID, <code><em>38593859</em></code>.</li>\n<li>The rest of the ranges contain no invalid IDs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Adding up all the invalid IDs in this example produces <code><em>1227775554</em></code>.</p>\n<p><em>What do you get if you add up all of the invalid IDs?</em></p>\n</article><article class=\"day-desc\"><h2 id=\"part2\">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>The clerk quickly discovers that there are still invalid IDs in the ranges in your list. Maybe the young Elf was doing other silly patterns as well?</p>\n<p>Now, an ID is invalid if it is made only of some sequence of digits repeated <em>at least</em> twice. So, <code>12341234</code> (<code>1234</code> two times), <code>123123123</code> (<code>123</code> three times), <code>1212121212</code> (<code>12</code> five times), and <code>1111111</code> (<code>1</code> seven times) are all invalid IDs.</p>\n<p>From the same example as before:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>11-22</code> still has two invalid IDs, <code><em>11</em></code> and <code><em>22</em></code>.</li>\n<li><code>95-115</code> now has two invalid IDs, <code><em>99</em></code> and <code><em>111</em></code>.</li>\n<li><code>998-1012</code> now has two invalid IDs, <code><em>999</em></code> and <code><em>1010</em></code>.</li>\n<li><code>1188511880-1188511890</code> still has one invalid ID, <code><em>1188511885</em></code>.</li>\n<li><code>222220-222224</code> still has one invalid ID, <code><em>222222</em></code>.</li>\n<li><code>1698522-1698528</code> still contains no invalid IDs.</li>\n<li><code>446443-446449</code> still has one invalid ID, <code><em>446446</em></code>.</li>\n<li><code>38593856-38593862</code> still has one invalid ID, <code><em>38593859</em></code>.</li>\n<li><code>565653-565659</code> now has one invalid ID, <code><em>565656</em></code>.</li>\n<li><code>824824821-824824827</code> now has one invalid ID, <code><em>824824824</em></code>.</li>\n<li><code>2121212118-2121212124</code> now has one invalid ID, <code><em>2121212121</em></code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Adding up all the invalid IDs in this example produces <code><em>4174379265</em></code>.</p>\n<p><em>What do you get if you add up all of the invalid IDs using these new rules?</em></p>\n</article>"

It's not fried; it just needs power.

The batteries are each labeled with their <a href=\"/2020/day/10\">joltage</a> rating, a value from <code>1</code> to <code>9</code>. You make a note of their joltage ratings (your puzzle input). For example:</p>\n<pre><code>987654321111111\n811111111111119\n234234234234278\n818181911112111\n</code></pre>\n<p>The batteries are arranged into <em>banks</em>; each line of digits in your input corresponds to a single bank of batteries.

For example, if you have a bank like <code>12345</code> and you turn on batteries <code>2</code> and <code>4</code>, the bank would produce <code>24</code> jolts.
